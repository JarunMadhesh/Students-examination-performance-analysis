# Students-examination-performance-analysis
Performance evaluation of students is essential to check their feasibility  of improvement. Regular evaluation not only improves the performance  of the students but also it helps in understanding where the students are  lagging. It takes a lot of manual effort to complete the evaluation process  and to see the bigger picture of the class as a whole. Most of the time,  evaluation of the exams alone wouldn’t help much on studying the  performance of students and find room for improvement.  In this project, We analyse the performance of students in their  examination and take dive onto several factors that could affect the  performance and measure it’s effect on them
